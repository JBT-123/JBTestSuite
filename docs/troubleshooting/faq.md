- **Organization**: Group related tests with common tags
- **Best practices**: Use consistent tag vocabulary across your team

## Test Execution

### How does browser automation work?
JBTestSuite uses Selenium WebDriver with a Chromium browser running in a Docker container:
- **Isolated environment**: Each test runs in a clean browser session
- **Screenshot capture**: Automatic screenshots during key test steps
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live view of browser actions via WebSocket
- **Headless operation**: Browser runs without GUI for faster execution
- **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup after test completion

### Can I see the browser while tests are running?
- **Live screenshots**: Real-time screenshot capture during execution
- **WebSocket updates**: Live progress monitoring in the web interface
- **VNC access**: Connect to selenium container for direct browser viewing (advanced)
- **Artifacts**: All screenshots saved for post-execution review

### Why do my tests sometimes fail randomly?
Common causes of flaky tests:
- **Timing issues**: Page elements not fully loaded before interaction
- **Dynamic content**: Elements that change position or state
- **Network delays**: Slow responses from external services
- **Resource constraints**: Insufficient memory or CPU during execution
- **Solutions**: Increase retry counts, improve wait strategies, isolate test data

### How do I debug test failures?
1. **Check screenshots**: Visual evidence of what went wrong
2. **Review logs**: Detailed execution logs with error messages
3. **Examine timing**: Look for timeout or timing-related issues
4. **Validate selectors**: Ensure element selectors are still valid
5. **Test environment**: Verify target application is accessible and functional

## AI Features

### Do I need an OpenAI API key?
- **Required for AI features**: Test generation, screenshot analysis, intelligent insights
- **Optional for basic features**: Test execution, management, and monitoring work without AI
- **Setup**: Add your API key to environment variables
