# TICKET-002: Core Data Layer Implementation

## Description
Implement Phase 2 of the JBTestSuite implementation roadmap: build comprehensive core data layer with enhanced database models, migrations, and REST API endpoints. This expands on the basic foundation from Phase 1 to create a robust, scalable data architecture for the web automation testing platform.

## Technical Specifications

### Database Models Architecture
**Domain Separation:**
- **Test Definition**: TestCase, TestStep, TestSuite, TestTemplate
- **Execution Tracking**: TestRun, TestExecution, TestStepExecution
- **Artifact Management**: Screenshot, LogEntry, TestReport
- **Configuration**: BrowserConfiguration, TestEnvironment

**Key Relationships:**
- TestCase (1) → TestStep (N) - Test steps within a test case
- TestSuite (N) ← → TestCase (N) - Many-to-many test organization
- TestRun (1) → TestExecution (N) - Execution instances per run
- TestExecution (1) → TestStepExecution (N) - Step-level execution tracking
- TestStepExecution (1) → Screenshot (N) - Screenshots per step

### API Endpoint Design
**Advanced Features Required:**
- Filtering: `?status=active&tags=smoke,regression`
- Pagination: `?page=1&limit=50`
- Sorting: `?sort_by=created_at&order=desc`
- Field Selection: `?fields=id,name,status`
- Bulk Operations: `POST /api/v1/tests/bulk` for multiple operations

### Performance Optimization
**Strategic Indexing:**
- Composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- Full-text search indexes on test names and descriptions
- Foreign key indexes for relationship queries
- Partial indexes for filtered queries (e.g., active tests only)

## Dependencies
- **Upstream**: TICKET-001 (Foundation Infrastructure) must be completed
- **Downstream**: Required for Phase 3 (Basic UI Integration)
- **External**: None - builds on existing Docker environment

## Success Criteria Details

### Functional Success
- All CRUD operations work correctly across all models
- Complex queries (joins, aggregations) perform under 100ms
- Bulk operations handle 100+ items efficiently
- API pagination works correctly for large datasets
- Error handling provides meaningful feedback

### Technical Success
- Database migrations are reversible and error-free
- All API endpoints have comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic schemas enforce data integrity
- Database constraints prevent invalid data states
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets

### Quality Success
