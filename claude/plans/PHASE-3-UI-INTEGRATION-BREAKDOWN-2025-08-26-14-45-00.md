# PHASE-3: Basic UI Integration Breakdown

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 focuses on creating a functional frontend for test management by integrating the React/TypeScript client with the existing FastAPI backend. This phase builds on the completed infrastructure (Phase 1) and data layer (Phase 2) to deliver a working test case management interface.

## Current State Analysis

**What We Have (Completed):**

- ✅ Basic navigation structure and placeholder pages
- ✅ FastAPI server with comprehensive REST API endpoints
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models and database schema
- ✅ Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for test cases and steps

**What We Need:**
- Functional UI components for test case management
- Client-server communication through TanStack Query
- Form handling for create/edit operations
- Data tables with filtering and pagination
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Detailed Task Breakdown

   - Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
   - Progress indicators for long operations

3. Enhance navigation and routing
   - Breadcrumb navigation for deep pages
   - Back button handling
   - URL state for filters and pagination
   - Proper route preloading
