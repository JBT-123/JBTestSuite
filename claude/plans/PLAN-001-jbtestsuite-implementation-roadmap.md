- Comprehensive architecture documentation in ROADMAP.md
- Clear technology stack definition
- Development workflow processes

**What We Need:**
- Complete project file structure (client/, server/, docker-compose.yml)

- Core application functionality
- Integration between all components

## Objectives

- [ ] Establish working Docker Compose development environment
- [ ] Create complete project structure matching architecture
- [ ] Implement core backend API with database integration
- [ ] Develop functional frontend with server communication
- [ ] Integrate Selenium and AI services
- [ ] Achieve comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment

## Architecture Implementation Strategy

### Foundation-First Approach
Build a solid foundation that supports incremental complexity:

- Testing and quality runs parallel to development phases

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to building JBTestSuite from its current boilerplate state to a fully functional platform. The foundation-first approach ensures stability while the phased implementation allows for iterative improvement and risk management.

The plan prioritizes getting a working system early, then adding complexity incrementally. This approach supports continuous development and testing while maintaining system stability throughout the implementation process.
